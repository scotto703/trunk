12/9/2009 9:41:54 PM: jmac Silvercloud: i think they wanted to create a simulation of her buying something, but they never coded it. Just had comments about it
12/9/2009 9:42:54 PM: Migizi Foehammer: well i believe her movement that you have going is supposed to be a simulation
12/9/2009 9:42:57 PM: jmac Silvercloud: didnt thnk you were getting off the meditation seat :-0
12/9/2009 9:43:34 PM: Page Miami: it was nice, but then ended up in the poi pond!
12/9/2009 9:43:54 PM: jmac Silvercloud: in a way ... yes. though I was always thinking a simulation is events taking place with 2 or more bots engaged in it
12/9/2009 9:44:40 PM: Migizi Foehammer: yeah the whole what is a simulation always gets confusing
12/9/2009 9:45:16 PM: jmac Silvercloud: yes. but i think it is when you create events with 2 or more bots interacting with each other
12/9/2009 9:45:54 PM: jmac Silvercloud: so for say a systems analysis class. you could have oriana tell chesterfield what she thinks a pos system needs, etc. and the students can take notes
12/9/2009 9:46:14 PM: Alisandra Cascarino: I should go to the grocery store to pick up a few things.

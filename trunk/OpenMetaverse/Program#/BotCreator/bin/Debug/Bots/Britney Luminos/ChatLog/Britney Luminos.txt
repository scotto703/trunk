12/7/2009 9:11:47 PM: jmac Silvercloud: i am making sure that the bots wear their outfirs instead of being a ball of white smoke
12/7/2009 9:11:55 PM: Tyson Dexler: ok
12/7/2009 9:12:07 PM: Tyson Dexler: yeah Tracy was actually there
12/7/2009 9:12:18 PM: Tyson Dexler: but then I loaded her again
12/7/2009 9:12:23 PM: Tyson Dexler: and she was a ball of smoke
12/7/2009 9:12:24 PM: jmac Silvercloud: correct
12/7/2009 9:12:33 PM: jmac Silvercloud: i have it fixed in the program i am using

12/7/2009 9:14:50 PM: Tyson Dexler: ooh ok
12/7/2009 9:15:12 PM: jmac Silvercloud: but you can test them by selecting them from a folder on your pc, which i see you have been doing
12/7/2009 9:15:45 PM: Tyson Dexler: yeah a couple but I had to make Britney's folder
12/7/2009 9:16:04 PM: jmac Silvercloud: ? she had no folder or no aiml files in her folder?
12/7/2009 9:16:10 PM: Tyson Dexler: I am not sure who I will go onto next
12/7/2009 9:16:14 PM: Tyson Dexler: she had no folder
12/7/2009 9:16:19 PM: jmac Silvercloud: hmmm ...

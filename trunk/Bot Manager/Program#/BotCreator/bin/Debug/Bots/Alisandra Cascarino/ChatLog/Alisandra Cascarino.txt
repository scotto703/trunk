12/9/2009 9:41:54 PM: jmac Silvercloud: i think they wanted to create a simulation of her buying something, but they never coded it. Just had comments about it
12/9/2009 9:42:54 PM: Migizi Foehammer: well i believe her movement that you have going is supposed to be a simulation
12/9/2009 9:42:57 PM: jmac Silvercloud: didnt thnk you were getting off the meditation seat :-0
12/9/2009 9:43:34 PM: Page Miami: it was nice, but then ended up in the poi pond!
12/9/2009 9:43:54 PM: jmac Silvercloud: in a way ... yes. though I was always thinking a simulation is events taking place with 2 or more bots engaged in it
12/9/2009 9:44:40 PM: Migizi Foehammer: yeah the whole what is a simulation always gets confusing
12/9/2009 9:45:16 PM: jmac Silvercloud: yes. but i think it is when you create events with 2 or more bots interacting with each other
12/9/2009 9:45:54 PM: jmac Silvercloud: so for say a systems analysis class. you could have oriana tell chesterfield what she thinks a pos system needs, etc. and the students can take notes
12/9/2009 9:46:14 PM: Alisandra Cascarino: I should go to the grocery store to pick up a few things.

5/13/2010 12:12:43 AM: Alisandra Cascarino: Hi everyone!
5/13/2010 12:12:43 AM: Shogo Warwillow: I see. I'll have to play around with it a little more later. Figured I'd at least set this up for class.
5/13/2010 12:12:56 AM: jmac Silvercloud: For Baker?
5/13/2010 12:13:19 AM: Shogo Warwillow: Yeah. Our teacher wants us to meet here about once a week.
5/13/2010 12:13:44 AM: jmac Silvercloud: I was a previous intern on this project
5/13/2010 12:13:56 AM: Shogo Warwillow: Cool.
5/13/2010 12:13:57 AM: jmac Silvercloud: still mess around with it a bit
5/13/2010 12:14:45 AM: Shogo Warwillow: Well, we'll see what the professor has in store for us up here. I'm expecting he just wants to have converstations on system analysis.
5/13/2010 12:15:17 AM: Shogo Warwillow: It doesn't help that we have 5 chapters to read either.
5/13/2010 12:16:21 AM: jmac Silvercloud: The bots are programmmed with system analysis information. Are you taking the courses for a masters?
5/13/2010 12:16:50 AM: Shogo Warwillow: Yup. This is for MIS 611.
5/13/2010 12:17:19 AM: jmac Silvercloud: Nice! I just finished my Associates and starting my Bachelors in CS.
5/13/2010 12:17:51 AM: Shogo Warwillow: Sweet. The programs are pretty good, and I prefer online classes, so this works out pretty well.
5/13/2010 12:18:08 AM: jmac Silvercloud: yup, me too. I got my associates all 100% online!
5/13/2010 12:18:47 AM: Shogo Warwillow: Nice. After this class, i'll have 5 classes to go before I'm done. Hopefully, I'll still have my sanity by then.
5/13/2010 12:19:14 AM: jmac Silvercloud: No kidding. The masters courses looked extremely difficult
5/13/2010 12:19:53 AM: Shogo Warwillow: Most of them are not that bad. When you get into the MIS 6xx stuff, that's when it starts to hit you.
5/13/2010 12:20:07 AM: jmac Silvercloud: Lots of research?
5/13/2010 12:20:23 AM: Alisandra Cascarino: OMG! How long was I daydreaming??? I need to get to the admissions office!!!"
5/13/2010 12:21:07 AM: Shogo Warwillow: Exactly. Research and group projects. The MIS 5xx classes were a bit of a challenge, but it's mostly straightforward.
5/13/2010 12:21:55 AM: jmac Silvercloud: Cool. It sounded time consumingwhen I read it in the Baker Program book. Good Luck with it, I gotta run
